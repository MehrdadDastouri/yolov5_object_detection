# Object Detection with YOLOv5

This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv5 model for object detection in images. YOLOv5 is a highly efficient and accurate object detection model.

## Features
- Detect objects in images using the pre-trained YOLOv5 model.
- Visualize bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.
- Save detection results to the local `runs/detect/` directory.

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies:
   - PyTorch
   - OpenCV
   - Matplotlib
   - Ultralytics YOLOv5
2. Place an image in the project directory and set its path in the `image_path` variable.
3. Run the script:
